Instructions:
- A sample observed file has been copied into this directory with the filename 'rswap_observed_data.csv'

- The filename must always be: 'rswap_observed_data.csv'

- Fill in your observed data following the below rules:

 ** FORMAT RULES **
	- Seperator must be "," 
	- Delimiter must be "."
	- Date format must be "2013-12-31"
Things might still work with different formats, but use these to be safe. 

 ** CONTENT RULES **
	- Left-most column must be labelled "DATE". please use same date format as in example
		to avoid any formatting issues. All observed data must be matched to this 
		single date column!

	- Observed variables must be named in the column the same way they are named in SWAP.
		(see example) otherwise they will not be compared. (ie. "DRAINAGE")

	- For the variable name: if the observed variable is measured at a certain depth add
		an underscore ("_") and enter the (positive) depth in centimeters (cm)
		after it. (see example) (ie. "WC_15")

	- You can add in as many variables for as many dates as you wish as long as you 
		follow the formatting rules.
