Instructions:

- Left-most column must be labelled "DATE". please use same date format as in example
	to avoid any formatting issues. All observed data must be matched to this 
 	single date column!

- Observed variables must be named in the column the same way they are named in SWAP.
	(see example) otherwise they will not be compared. (ie. "DRAINAGE")

- For the variable name: if the observed variable is measured at a certain depth add
	an underscore ("_") and enter the (positive) depth in centimeters (cm)
	after it. (see example) (ie. "WC_15")

- You can add in as many variables for as many dates as you wish as long as you 
	follow the formatting rules.
